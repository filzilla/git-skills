    <h1>Phillip D'Elia<h1>

      <p>
          I am originally from Northern Virginia, just outside the DC area.  I moved to Charleston in 1999.
          I studed Landscape architture at Virginia Tech and have been working in the Landscape Architecture and desgin field.
          I have grown a bit bored with my work the last few years, and decided to try writing software.  I think that this will
          allow me to fullfill both my creative needs, and my desire to constantly be learning new things.
